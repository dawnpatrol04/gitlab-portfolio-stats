# GitLab FastAPI Integration

This project provides an API interface to retrieve and manage data from GitLab.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables (e.g., `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_URL`) or add them to a `.env` file in the project root.

3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to access the API.

## Endpoints

- `/projects/`: Retrieve all projects.
- ... (add other endpoints as you define them)

## Notes

- Make sure to handle your GitLab token securely.
- This is a sample project; ensure you test thoroughly before deploying to a production environment.
